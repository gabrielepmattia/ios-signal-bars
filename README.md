# Signal Bars
*Old signal bars for iOS - Winterboard theme* by **gabry3795**

This is the source of winterboard theme on Cydia - [see here](http://apt.thebigboss.org/onepackage.php?bundleid=org.thebigboss.signalbarsios7theme)

## Note
I can't recompile the tweak for iOS9+ because I left Apple devices, but **you can if you want**. Just fork this repo and update it, then make a pull request
